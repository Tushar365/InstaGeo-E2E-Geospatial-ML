        "In this demonstration, we use ground truth geospatial point observations for cropland classification in Rwanda. The notebook will guide you through the process of creating segmentation-like data from these observations, fine-tuning the [Prithvi](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-100M) model, and finally visualizing the inference results on an interactive map.\n",

        "By the end of this demo, you will gain hands-on experience with key InstaGeo functionalities and learn how it streamlines geospatial ML workflows from data preparation to model inference."
